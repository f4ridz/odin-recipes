    <h2>What is Caesar Salad?</h2>
    <p>
      The salad is said to have been made and called after
      <strong>Caesar Cardini</strong> , an Italian immigrant who had restaurants
      in Mexico and the United States. Here's the best Caesar salad recipe I
      have ever tasted! A wonderful, rich, anchovy dressing makes this salad a
      meal. Serve with crusty Italian bread.
